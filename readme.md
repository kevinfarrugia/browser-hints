# Performance Test Results Cheatsheet

Test Results: https://kevinfarrugia.github.io/performance-test-results-cheatsheet/

The goal of this project is to provide a number of simple scenarios, their WPT results and an explanation on why the performance improves or degrades. Please feel free to suggest your own test scenarios, test results and explanations.

## Getting Started
The project may be run on any simple webserver as it is comprised solely of static assets and there is no bundling process. Personally I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npx serve`.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the repository folder
3. Run the web server:
```
npx serve
```
